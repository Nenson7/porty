            <h2>Message from the Principal</h2>
            <p>When I talk about Jubilant Elite Academy, I feel deeply honored and proud to share its unique educational features with people around me. In the aftermath of 2007 people's movement, 240 years of monarchy was abolished in the 5th amendment of the interim constitution and our nation was declared as the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, which envisioned federalization as a prominent feature of New Nepal. However, the truth is that democracry and federalization of our country cannot survive unless it comprises of physically and mentally healthy citizens. Absence of the factors results in backwardness, retardation, emotional disturbance and even delinquency. Exploring the above mentioned factual threats of our nation. Jubilant Elite Academy has come up with innovative institutional planning that includes sports and music club, which enables educator to encourage students for their physical and mental well being.</p>
            <p>Jubilant Elite Academy's educational system has been designed to assist our children in organizing his/her daily routine with (WFT). Fortnightly (FT) followed by three terminal examination as their long-term assignments in order to help our students achieve academic excellence.</p>
            <p>We have made arrangements for spiritual activities along with various co-curricular activities to motivate our students such that they can strive towards a better life and consider personal growth and fulfillment as a central goal. Spirituality can be considered to be a path to ward self-actualization since it requires people to be focus on their internal value and work on becoming a better individual personally believe that spiritual people are gracious.</p>
            <p>Therefore, creating pleasant atmosphere at home, making comfortable working place for child to be able to study at home asking dos and don'ts about their life at home, sharing personal experience about your school year, setting an examples and involving oneself in the schooling, justify your involvement in schooling by action etc. plays significant role in shaping their fortune.</p>
            <p>I welcome parents/guardians participation and their support during the school year. As we celebrate the 10th anniversary of J.E.A. I want to place on record my sincere gratitude to all those who worked beyond their call of duty to make J.E.A. a vibrant educational institution of Ilam, Nepal.</p>

            <h2>Message from the Director</h2>
            <p>In the early days of the year 2064 B.S. I had made up my mind to make noteworthy contribution for the welfare of the nation, the society and its people. With this inspiration and from the blessing of my father and mother. I laid the foundation of Jubilant Elite Academy; an educational institution established at the heart of the town Ilam. Its official date of establishment is Bhadra 19, 2065 as registered at the office of the company Registrar, Government of Nepal, Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies.</p>
            <p>Jubilant Elite Academy is an English medium co-educational private boarding school. It's mission is to provide an excellent academic achievement for every student with an all-round outstanding development. The students are encouraged to take part in curricular activities and are even asked to join the SUPW (Socially Useful Productive Work) class. They are trained to be capable to develop a good personality. The children of kinder world are taught through Montessori Method. They have their small world confined with themselves. The entire kinder world has a very safe and fun loving environment with a beautiful garden and a wide green lawn to match the entire sloping landscape. The children here can learn while they play. Students of senior classes are taught by qualified teachers. They acquire knowledge with their involvement in the science and computer lab, and the smart class or Midas e-class helping them for grooming to excel in the competitive world.</p>
            <p>We have a wonderful team of teachers, staffs and a managing body of the school. Talking about the school principal and teachers, "They are the best" and even beyond words can express. Most of the teachers are extremely hardworking, devoted and concerned about the students. They are capable to train their students with much care and dedication so much so that only words of application would not be able to justify their good deeds.</p>

            <p>Jubilant Elite Academy is situated at the centre of Ilam Municipality. Considering its tight space and a very high value of space. We have to be satisfied with the angle area that has been provided. We have constructed two new R.C.C multi stored masonry building of a wider length along with a basketball court, a badminton court and a few table tennis boards. The construction of the buildings and other infrastructures were done by a team of engineers, qualified technicians and highly skilled labors. These constructions produced a very strong infrastructure, safe, ample of shelter and a peaceful environment.</p>
            <p>Beautiful Ilam commonly known as "Queen of the Hill Station" has one of the most pleasant climate of the world. It is due to these factors that I would like to take an opportunity to request all the people of Nepal to make Ilam as education center and the most advanced educational hub of the nation. The excellent results of the school in the SEE exams are its own rewards.</p>
